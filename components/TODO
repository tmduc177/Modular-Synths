- Vary Jack placement for Slider
- Create Light component
- Add drawLight() for Dial and Slider
- Move all property determinants into constructor for components;
- Add a method that returns all non-dependent properties for components;
- Modify constructor so that it has the ability to copy non-dependent properties from other components of the same type;
- Try inheritance, since after adding these methods, components will not only just have some shared properties, but also shared methods;
